[TimeManager] by ArVdC
config.yml
-----
*version*
 This field is automatically checked and refreshed, don't modify it manually.
-----
*refreshRate*
 The delay in ticks before actualizing the speed stretch/expand effect.
 Must be an integer between 2 and 20.
 Default value is 10 ticks, a too small value can cause server lags, depends on the server resources and the number of maps using a 'speed' modifier.
-----
*wakeUpTick*
 Players can wake up later than 6:00 am. Possible values are ticks from #0 to #6000.
-----
*newDayAt*
 It is possible to determine whether the new day will be counted from 06:00 (= tick #0) or from 00:00 (= tick #18000). Accepted values are 06:00, #0 or dawn and 00:00, #18000 or midnight.
-----
*worldsList*
 The list of available worlds will be refreshed on server startup. Nether and Ender worlds will be erased if needed.
  *start*
   Define the time at server startup for the specified world. By default, all worlds will start at tick #0. The tab completion also provides presets like "day", "night", etc.
   If a world is using the real time speed, the start value will determine the UTC time shift and values like +1 or -1 will be accepted.
  *daySpeed & nightSpeed*
   Define if the time will be locked, accelerated, decelerated or normally spend for the specified world.
   Use 0.0 to freeze time, numbers from 0.01 to 0.99 to slow time, 1.0 to get normal speed and numbers from 1.1 to 20.0 to speedup time.
   Set this value to 24.0 or 'realtime' to make the world time match the real speed time.
   Night and day speeds can be different from each other.
   It is also possible to use a 00d-00h-00m-00s format instead of the multiplier.
  *sleep*
   Since sleeping at night causes significant time changes, this is a priority setting to manage if you want to keep synchronization between maps.
   Three values are allowed: 'true', 'false' and 'linked'.
   If 'true', players can sleep until the next morning as usual.
   Turning this to 'false' will cancel sleep events but still allow the player to get into a bed and save their position.
   If you want to both allow sleep and keep the same time in multiple worlds, you can use the 'linked' function which allows a group of worlds to spend the night together.
  *sync*
   Define if the speed distortion method will increase/decrease the world's actual tick (false), or fit the theoretical tick value based on the server one (true).
   By default, all worlds will start with parameter false. Real time based worlds and frozen worlds do not use this option, on the other hand this will affect even the worlds with a normal speed.
   Enabling sync prevents players from sleeping and will automatically set the 'sleep' value to 'false'.
  *firstStartTime*
   This option allows you to force the time at which a world starts when starting the server.
   The 'default' value enables resynchronization on startup set by 'resetOnStartup' (see below for details).
   The 'previous' value returns the time in the world before the server was shut down.
   The 'start' value forces the world to start at the time specified in the world's 'start' node.
-----
*initialTick*
  *initialTickNb*
   This is the initial server tick that will be used as reference for time calculations. This value will be saved here unless you are using mySQL.
  *resetOnStartup*
   By setting it to 'true', the plugin will create a new reference tick on each server startup. World timers will resume at the time specified in their 'start' node.
   If resetOnStartup is set to 'false', your server will create a new reference tick only at the first startup, which makes it possible to create an artificial continuity in the timers of the worlds despite a stop/restart of the server.
   In case of working with several servers, at most one of them should turn it true. Set every related servers with an 'false' value will make the reference tick immutable.
  *useMySqlDb*
   Enable or not the mySql database (true or false), its provide a possible sharing of the reference server startup tick. See lower for more details.
----- 
*mySql*
 Permit to share the initial tick from a reference server to others. The first server using the database will create a reference tick into it.
 Use this with or without BungeeCord, just set 'initialTick.isHardSaved' and 'initialTick.useMySqlDb' to 'true' in each config.yml file.
 *host* *port* *ssl* *database* *username* *password*
   For 'host', use your server ip. (for example: 'localhost' or 'www.minecraftserver.com').
   Default mySQL port is '3306' but you could change it to match your custom configuration.
   Default database name is 'timemanager' but you could choose anything else to order it correctly.

-----
*updateMsgSrc*
 Choose a value between 'Bukkit', 'Curse', 'Spigot' or 'Github' to check the update when loading the plugin. Set to 'none', 'false' or '' to avoid verification. (MC 1.8.8+ only)
-----
*placeholders*
 It is possible to use TimeManager placeholders in other plugins. To do this, set the value to 'true' and place the third-party API in your 'plugins' folder.
 The available placeholders are described in lang.yml file.
 PlaceholderAPI (www.spigotmc.org/resources/placeholderapi.6245) -> Use %tm_xxx% instead of {tm_xxx}
 MVdWPlaceholderAPI (www.spigotmc.org/resources/mvdwplaceholderapi.11182) -> Use {tm_xxx}
  *inChatEnable*
   If true, the plugin's placeholders will be interpreted in chat messages.
  *inCommandsEnable*
   If true, the plugin's placeholders will be interpreted in any commands launched by the console, players or command blocks.
-----
*debugMode*
 Set true to enable colored verbose messages in the console. Useful to understand some mechanisms of this plugin.
